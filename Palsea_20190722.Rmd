# What's a chronology model?

Usual set up is:
- Have a core
- Some radiocarbon dates with depths
- Know the calibration curve that applies to these dates
- Might know the age of the top of the core (or a constraint on it)
- Might have some other types of dates as well

A chronology model will then give you estimated ages for any depth you choose in the core.

# Why should I care which model I use?

- To create a quantitative sea level reconstruction, you need a chronology model which includes uncertainty in its output

- The reconstructions of sea level will be sensitive to the choice of chronology model used

- If you’re using a proper reconstruction method, then the uncertainties will flow through from the chronology into the reconstruction

- If your uncertainties are too small, then the sea level reconstruction will be unrealistically precise and will not stand up to validation

# How to use Bchron

1. Get your data into the right format
1. Run `Bchronology` to get an age-depth model
1. Summarise or plot to get what you need

Everything is open source so you have full access and customization of all output and plots

Some extra features specifically for sea level work

# Bchron demo

```{r}
library(Bchron)
data("Sluggan")
head(Sluggan, 10)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
SlugOut = with(Sluggan, 
               Bchronology(ages = ages,
                           ageSds = ageSds, 
                           calCurves = calCurves,
                           positions = position, 
                           positionThicknesses = thickness,
                           ids = id, 
                           predictPositions = seq(44, 518, by = 1)))

```
```{r, include = FALSE}
SlugOut = readRDS(file = 'SlugganChron.rds')
```

---

# Plotting output

```{r, fig.height=5}
plot(SlugOut, dateHeight = 10) + 
  labs(x = 'Age (cal BP)', y = 'Depth (cm)',
       nudgeX = 500)
```

# Extra Bchron features

- Ability to calibrate thousands of dates in seconds

- Obtain sedimentation and accumulation rates (with uncertainties)

- Thickness errors

- Identify influential dates and depths

- Non-parametric phase estimation

- Simple rate and acceleration estimation for RSL data

- User-defined calibration curves

# `BchronRSL` demo

```{r}

# What’s next for chronology models?

- Creation of age-depths models for multiple cores with overlapping dating measurements

- Better outlier identification

- Adding in different date formats, e.g. Pb-210

- Creating sea level reconstruction (via e.g. transfer functions) and chronology models simultaneously

- Adding in mechanistic models of sedimentation

**What would other people like?**

# Conclusions

- Chronological models are not simple to build, but there are some good options out there

- Bchron and Bacon are R packages, with open-source code and full scripting capability

- Lots of extra features which may be useful for certain jobs

- Bchron is completely driven by the community and if people want more features then they can request them!
